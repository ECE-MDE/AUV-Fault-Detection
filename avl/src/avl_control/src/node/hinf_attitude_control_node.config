# Elevator and rudder angle output limit in degrees
max_fin_angle: 20.0

# Angle in degrees that elevators will be set to when there is no pitch command
# in order to keep the vehicle on the surface
elevators_up_angle: 20.0

# Enable or disable fin mixing, which adjusts elevator and rudder angles based
# on vehicle roll angle

# Controller iteration rate in Hz
iteration_rate: 10.0

# Minimum input message rates in Hz. Input messages must be received at a
# rate greater than this rate. Otherwise, the node will detect a fault and
# terminate
min_input_rate: 1.0

# Minimum setpoint message rates in Hz. Setpoint messages must be received
# at a rate greater than this rate. Otherwise, control node iteration will be
# stopped until a new setpoint is received
